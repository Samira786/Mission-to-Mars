# Mission-to-Mars Web Scraping Project
This web scraping project involved extracting data about Mars from an established webpage, using Mongo database to store it and displaying the extracted elements in a separate webpage (index.html) or webapp locally. We have also used a dataframe to show a table on the right providing some facts about Mars. <br />
Below is a simple diagram describing the project: <br />




The technology stack to complete this project included: <br />
Mongo Database, Beautiful Soup, Splinter, HTML/CSS, Flask Bootstrap, Python<br />
The files created for this project are: <br />
app.py, scraping.py, and index.html<br />
In order to run this app locally, we ensured that flask and mongodb were active on our local machine. <br />
Our html components included a Jumbotron with a Webscraping button, a featured image on the Mars website, a data table on the right and hemisphere information below. Our vision was below: <br />




And our website looked like below: <br />
